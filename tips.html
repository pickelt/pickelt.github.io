 <h1>Tips</h1>
<h2> Agents</h2>
 <p>First thing first you must find characters you are comfortable playing. With time you will be able to expand your character pool but to start it is good to find at least three chracters that you are really comfortable playing and preferably have them be different roles so no matter the situation you will be able to fill well.</p>
<h2> Communication</h2>
 <p>Communication is key in Valorant. You need to be able to communicate with your team where the enemies are, what your plans are, and what you need from them. If you are not communicating well with your team you will have a hard time winning games.</p>
<h2> Map Knowledge</h2>
 <p>Knowing the maps is very important in Valorant. You need to know where the chokepoints are, where the spike sites are, and where the best places to hold angles are. The more you play the game the more you will learn about the maps.</p>
<h2> Crosshair Placement</h2>
 <p>Crosshair placement is very important in Valorant. You need to be able to keep your crosshair at head level and be able to pre-aim common angles. This will help you get more kills and win more gunfights.</p>
<h2> Economy Management</h2>
 <p>Managing your economy is very important in Valorant. You need to be able to save money when you can and buy when you need to. You also need to be able to communicate with your team about what you are buying and when you are buying it.</p>
